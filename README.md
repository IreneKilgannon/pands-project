# pands-project

This is my analysis of the Fisher's Iris data set for the programming and scripting module.

## Project Plan
* Research the project and summarise it in a README.
* Download the data set and add it to my repository.
* Write a program called analysis.py: 
    1. outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
    2. saves a histogram of each variable to png files
    3. outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
    4. any other analysis
