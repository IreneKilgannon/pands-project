# pands-project

This is my analysis of the Fisher's Iris data set for the programming and scripting module.

## Project Statement
* Research the data set and summarise it in a README.
* Download the data set and add it to my repository. TICK DONE
* Write a program called analysis.py: 
    1. outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
    2. saves a histogram of each variable to png files
    3. outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables
    4. any other analysis

# Summary of the data set

## History of the Data Set
In 1928 Edgar Anderson published his paper entitled ['The Problem of Species in the Northern Blue Flags, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica'](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/15997721). Anderson was a evolutionary biologist interested in answering two questions namely, what are species and how have they originated? Between 1923 and 1928 he and his team studied Iris versicolor, at a number of different sites from Ontario in Canada to Alabama in the United States, by measuring a number of different iris characteristics. Surprisingly his study found that there were actually two different iris species present, Iris versicolor and Iris virginia and that it was possible to differentiate them by geographic location and plant measurements. 

The data set is also known as Fisher's Iris data set after the statistician and biologist, Ronald Fisher. The data measurements for Isis setosa and Iris versicolor were collected by Anderson from the same colony of plants in Gaspe, in Quebec in 1935. According to [Unwin and Kleinman](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4331526?seq=13) the Iris virginica data samples were from Anderson's original research in 1928 and were collected in Camden, Tennessee. In 1936 Fisher analysed the data and published his results in the Annals of Eugenics [The Use of Multilpe Measurements in Taxonomic Problems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x).

Whats in the data set? Variables

Use of the data set?  Recent papers? Who would have thought that nearly one hundred years later the data that he collected would still be widely used by hundreds if not thousands of students interested in learning statistics, data science or machine learning?
